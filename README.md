# Glitch-Dash
Glitch Dash is a fast-paced action-arcade survival game where players control a block to dodge falling obstacles and collect points to climb the high-score leaderboard. Set in a neon-lit, futuristic 3D world, it challenges reflexes and reaction times with simple yet addictive mechanics.


My prototype will include the following core features:
● Basic movement mechanics (left, right, and jump using arrow keys or WASD).
● Falling blocks obstacles that accelerate every 30 seconds.
● Collectible neon orbs that add 10 points to the score when touched.
● Basic UI elements: score counter, survival timer, and game over screen.
● A simple neon environment with glowing obstacle effects.
● Main menu with start/exit options and a restart button on game over.
In my prototype, players will control a block character that must dodge randomly falling
obstacles while collecting points. The game will gradually increase in difficulty, testing the
player’s reaction time and survival skills.
