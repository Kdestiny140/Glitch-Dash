# Glitch-Dash
Glitch Dash is a fast-paced action-arcade survival game where players control a block, dodging falling obstacles to progress to the next level. Set in a neon-lit, futuristic 3D world, it tests reflexes and reaction times with simple yet addictive mechanics.

The player spawns on a platform as blocks rain down from above. They must avoid these obstacles and navigate toward collectibles to advance to the next level. The challenge intensifies as blocks fall faster and new hazards emerge. The game ends when an obstacle hits the player, presenting an option to quit or restart from level 1 for another attempt.
